Feature: Test the permissions in UDB3

  Background:
    Given I am using the UDB3 base URL
    And I am using an UiTID v1 API key of consumer "uitdatabank"
    And I send and accept "application/json"
    And I am authorized as JWT provider v1 user "invoerder_lgm"
    And I create a place from "places/molenhuis.json" and save the "id" as "uuid_place_molenhuis"

    And I am authorized as JWT provider v1 user "invoerder_dfm"
    And I set the JSON request payload from "places/citadel.json"
    And I send a POST request to "/imports/places/"
    And I keep the value of the JSON response at "id" as "uuid_place_citadel"
    And I set the JSON request payload from "events/rondleiding-citadel.json"
    And I send a POST request to "/imports/events/"
    And I keep the value of the JSON response at "id" as "uuid_event_rondleiding"
    And I wait for the event with url "/events/%{uuid_event_rondleiding}" to be indexed
