Feature: Test the permissions for places in UDB3

  Background:
    Given I am using the UDB3 base URL
    And I am using an UiTID v1 API key of consumer "uitdatabank"
    And I am authorized as JWT provider v1 user "invoerder_gbm"
    And I send and accept "application/json"
    And I create a place from "places/place.json" and save the "id" as "placeId"

  Scenario: get permissions of the current user who is the creator
    Given I am authorized as JWT provider v1 user "invoerder_gbm"
    When I send a GET request to "/places/%{placeId}/permissions/"
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should be:
        """
