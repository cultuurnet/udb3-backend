Feature: Test updating places

  Background:
    Given I am using the UDB3 base URL
    And I am using an UiTID v1 API key of consumer "uitdatabank"
    And I am authorized as JWT provider v1 user "centraal_beheerder"
    And I send and accept "application/json"
    And I create a place from "places/place.json" and save the "url" as "placeUrl"

  Scenario: Update required properties of place via legacy major-info endpoint
    When I set the JSON request payload to:
    """
