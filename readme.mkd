# Database migrations

UDB3 Silex uses [Doctrine Migrations](http://doctrine-migrations.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) 
to manage database schema updates.

Use the Doctrine DBAL command line utility to run one of the available 
migrations commands. To show all available migrations commands, use:

```
./vendor/bin/doctrine-dbal list migrations
```
